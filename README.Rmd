## Installation
<!-- install: start -->
The list of dependencies required to install this package is: magrittr, testthat.

To install the package, you can run the following script

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_local(path = "finddxtemplate_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz")
```

In case something went wrong, you may want to install dependencies before using:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# No Remotes ----
# Attachments ----
to_install <- c("magrittr")
  for (i in to_install) {
    message(paste("looking for ", i))
    if (!requireNamespace(i)) {
      message(paste("     installing", i))
      install.packages(i)
    }
  }
```

<!-- install: end -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(finddxtemplate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
